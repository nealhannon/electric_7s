This is a python3 program for the drinking card game "Electric 7's"

How to play and rules:
-Select the number of players
-The 4 different suits sevens from a deck of cards will be laid out and the remaining cards will be
 evenly dealt to the players
-Starting with player one, the players will take turns adding their cards to the laid down by suit. The

-The goal of the game is to play cards down as to branch out numerically in either direction from the sevens
 of each suit already played. If the player is able to play a card in a suit that continues on either
 side of the already played cards without a break, they give out the number of drinks equal to the number
 of cards played in that suit. Drinks can be given in any quantity to any player, including them self.
        EXAMPLE: Player one plays the 9 of clubs on. 6-8 of clubs have already been played. Player gives
 4 drinks.
-If the player plays a card that creates a break in the numbers in that suit, they must take a number of
 drinks equal to the range of the lowest card to the highest card, including any gaps.
        EXAMPLE: Player one plays the 9 of clubs. 6 and 7 of clubs have already been played. Player takes
 4 drinks.
-The game is over once every player has played all of their cards.
