This is a python3 program for the drinking card game "Electric 7's." This is my first project since learning
python so i hope you enjoy it!

How to play and rules:
-Select the number of players (3 - 6)
-The 4 different suit's Sevens from a deck of cards will be laid out and the remaining cards will be
  evenly dealt to the players
-Starting with player one, the players will take turns adding their cards to the already laid down card
  by suit.
       -Cards are played by typing the number followed by of and the suit. EX: 7 of clubs
-The goal of the game is to play cards down as to branch out numerically in either direction from the sevens
  of each suit already played. If the player is able to play a card in a suit that continues on either
  side of the already played cards without a break in the order of cards, they give out the number of
  drinks equal to the number of cards played in that suit. Drinks can be given in any quantity to any 
  player, including them self.
        EXAMPLE: Player one plays the 9 of clubs. 6-8 of clubs have already been played. Player one gives
  4 drinks.
-If the player plays a card that creates a break in the numbers in that suit, they must take a number of
  drinks equal to the range of the lowest card to the highest card, including any gaps.
        EXAMPLE: Player one plays the 9 of clubs. 6-7 of clubs have already been played. Player takes
  4 drinks.
-The game is over once every player has played all of their cards.
-Have fun and drink responsibly!!!!!
